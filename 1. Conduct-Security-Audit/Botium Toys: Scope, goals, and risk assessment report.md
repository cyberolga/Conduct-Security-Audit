# Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

## Scope and Goals of the Audit

### Scope
The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes their assets like employee equipment and devices, their internal network, and their systems. You will need to review the assets Botium Toys has and the controls and compliance practices they have in place.

### Goals
- Assess existing assets.
- Complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

## Current Assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include:
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs.
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
- Storefront products available for retail sale on-site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse.
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management.
- Internet access.
- Internal network.
- Data retention and storage.
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### Control Best Practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is **Identify**. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

### Risk Score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is **8**, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

### Additional Comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private and secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:
- Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
- Encryption is not currently used to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database.
- Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
- The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
- The IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
- Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.
